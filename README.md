I am so in love with Linux _(Not [Linus](https://github.com/torvalds)!)._
I am personally very fond of the commands `fortune` and `cowsay`, so much
that every time when my terminal session starts, I spare 2-5 seconds with
new fortunes. But there were many ones which I wanted to store somewhere
and look over again. So, that's why you are reading this now.
