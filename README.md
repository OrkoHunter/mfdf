### To quote from a sysadmin's personal notes
 There are two types of Linux users :

> 1. One who ❤ Linux

> 2. One who wish Windows was made for programming.

I am so in love with Linux. I am personally very fond of the commands `fortune` and `cowsay`, so much
that every time when my terminal session starts, I spare 2-5 seconds with
new fortunes. But there were many ones which I wanted to store somewhere
and look over again. So, that's why you are reading this now.
